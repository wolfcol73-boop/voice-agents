 ## Reflection Questions
 ### 1. Branch Design Challenge
 It was challenging for Me to design the conversation branches in order to help me out in my personal and work life. It would be easier if I was able to hook up my calendar The agent would be able to see everything that I deal with. I did discover that depending on what path I chose the Voice AG Agent change their motivation for answering my question. For my ideas I programmed it for it to brainstorm with me and for my task questions I programmed it so that it would give me specific answers and help me make hard decisions.

 ### 2. Knowledge Base Impact
tThe knowledge based content helped my AG go into a right direction by helping it realize what a great assistant will do and implemented that for me. They asked great questions back to me and help me solve hard scheduling issues.

 ### 3. Conversation Flow
Having this voice agent on the desk maybe as like an Alexa would really help busy people that wouldn't need a full time assistant. It'd be great for businesses that are just starting, college students that need help scheduling, and even parents that I have a hard time balancing work and family. Having an Assistant Think deep for you and align time schedules for you woodwork wonders for people that are too busy but not "big time".
